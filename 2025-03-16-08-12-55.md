3. Utilize Cohere's Models
After setting up the SDK, you can start using Cohere's models. Here's a basic example using the Python SDK:

import cohere

# Initialize the Cohere client with your API key
co = cohere.Client('YOUR_API_KEY')

# Generate a response using the 'command' model
response = co.generate(
  model='command',
  prompt='Translate the following English text to French: "Hello, how are you?"',
  max_tokens=50
)

# Print the generated response
print(response.generations[0].text)
This script sends a prompt to the Cohere model and prints the generated response. For more detailed examples and advanced usage, visit the Cohere API Reference.

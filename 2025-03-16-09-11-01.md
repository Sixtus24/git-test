# Getting Started with Cohere's Language Models

Cohere provides versatile language models accessible through various platforms. This guide will walk you through selecting the appropriate platform, setting up your account, obtaining an API key, installing the SDK, and integrating the models into your applications.

## 1. Choose Your Platform

Cohere's models are available on multiple platforms. Select the one that aligns with your development environment:

### a. Cohere Platform

Access models directly via Cohere's hosted infrastructure.

- **Setup Guide:** [Sign up and get an API key](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/the-cohere-platform)

### c. Cloud AI Services

Access models through managed services from cloud providers:

- **Amazon SageMaker:** [Setup Guide](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/amazon-sagemaker-setup-guide)
- **Azure AI Foundry:** [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/)
- **Oracle OCI:** [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/home.htm)

## 2. Create a Cohere Account

If you haven't already, create an account on the Cohere platform:

- **Sign Up:** [Cohere Dashboard](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/welcome/login)

## 3. Generate an API Key

An API key is required to authenticate your applications with Cohere's services. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. **Log In:** Access your account at the [Cohere Dashboard](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/welcome/login).
2. **Navigate to API Keys:** Go to the [API Keys section](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/api-keys).
3. **Create a New Key:** Click on "New Trial Key," assign a name (e.g., "Development"), and generate the key.
4. **Copy the Key:** Save the generated key securely; you'll need it for authentication.

*Note: Trial keys may have usage limitations. For production use, consider obtaining a full-access key.*

## 4. Install the Cohere SDK

Cohere offers SDKs in multiple programming languages. Choose the one that matches your development environment:

### a. Python

- **Installation Command:**

  ```bash
  pip install cohere
  ```


- **Documentation:** [Cohere Python SDK](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/get-started-installation)

### b. TypeScript

- **Installation Command:**

  ```bash
  npm install cohere-ai
  ```


- **Documentation:** [Cohere TypeScript SDK](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/get-started-installation)

### c. Java

- **Maven Dependency:**

  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>ai.cohere</groupId>
      <artifactId>cohere-java</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
  ```


- **Documentation:** [Cohere Java SDK](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/get-started-installation)

### d. Go

- **Installation Command:**

  ```bash
  go get -u github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-go
  ```


- **Documentation:** [Cohere Go SDK](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/get-started-installation)

## 5. Integrate Cohere's Models into Your Application

With the SDK installed and API key ready, you can now integrate Cohere's models:

### a. Initialize the Client

Use your API key to authenticate:

```python
import cohere

co = cohere.Client('YOUR_API_KEY')
```


### b. Generate Text (Example: Python)

Here's how to generate text using the Cohere client:

```python
response = co.generate(
    model='command-xlarge',
    prompt='Translate the following English text to French: "{}"'.format("Hello, how are you?"),
    max_tokens=60
)

print('Translation:', response.generations[0].text.strip())
```


*This example translates an English sentence to French using the 'command-xlarge' model.*

### c. Explore Other Features

Cohere offers additional functionalities such as:

- **Embeddings:** For semantic similarity and clustering.
- **Classification:** For categorizing text into predefined labels.
- **Chat:** For building conversational agents.

Refer to the [Cohere API Reference](https://docs.cohere.com/v1.1/reference) for detailed information.

## 6. Test and Deploy

After integrating the desired features:
